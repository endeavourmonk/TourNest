## We Develop with GitHub

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## First-time contributors

We've tagged some issues to make it easy to get started ðŸ˜„
[Good first issues](https://github.com/endeavourmonk/TourNest/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)

If you're interested in working on an issue, make sure it has either a `good-first-issue` or `up-for-grabs` label added. Add a comment on the issue and wait for the issue to be assigned before you start working on it. This helps to avoid multiple people working on similar issues.

## We Use [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Git-Flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `develop`. Please create the branch in the format feature/<issue-id>-<issue-name> (eg: feature/176-chart-widget)
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit) that covers the project.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issues](https://github.com/endeavourmonk/TourNest/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/endeavourmonk/TourNest/issues/new/choose). It's that easy!

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
